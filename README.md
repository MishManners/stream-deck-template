# Stream Deck Template for Screensaver

Template for the Elgato Stream Deck's new screensaver.

The examples we've built are Christmas themed featuring GitHub, Twilio, and Microsoft.

Template created by taking physical measurements of the Stream Decks and building the template in PhotoShop.

## Instructions

1. Download .psd file
2. Open PhotoShop file (obviously in PhotoShop)
3. What you'll see are a number of layers. The green layer is where you image will go. So choose a cool image that fits this.
4. Place your desired imaged on top of the file
5. Drag your new image layer underneath the "Green Layer"
6. Hide "Green layer"
7. Move your image around as desired (make sure you can see what you want through the keys)
8. When happy with the image and how it looks, hide the "Keys" layer
