# Stream Deck Template for Screensaver

Template for the Elgato Stream Deck's new screensaver.

The examples we've built are Christmas themed featuring GitHub, Twilio, and Microsoft.

Template created by taking physical measurements of the Stream Decks and building the template in PhotoShop.

Feel free to download and create your own images for the stream decks. All three sizes of stream deck are available: Mini, Standard, and XL.

## Instructions

1. Download .psd file
2. Open PhotoShop file (obviously in PhotoShop)
3. Place your desired imaged on the file
4. Drag your image layer underneath the "Deck" layer
5. Move your image around as desired (make sure you can see what you want through the keys)
6. When happy with the image and how it looks, hide the "Deck" layer
7. Export for finised product as JPEG or PNG.

When happy with everything, head to the settings on your stream deck by opening "Stream Deck" software. Add the "Sleep" button and select your new screensaver.

## Examples

Feel free to download and use the examples here. Go to the file and download each individually as those files will have the clean image (without the guiding grid).
