# Stream Deck Template for Screensaver

Template for the Elgato Stream Deck's new screensaver.

The examples we've built are Christmas themed featuring GitHub, Twilio, and Microsoft.

Big thanks to [aphealion](https://www.reddit.com/user/aphaelion/) on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/elgato/comments/jcj0xf/stream_deck_screensaver_templates_xl_regular/) for doing a sweet template which I could take and modify.
